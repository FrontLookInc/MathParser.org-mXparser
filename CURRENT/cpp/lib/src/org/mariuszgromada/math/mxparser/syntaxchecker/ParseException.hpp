 *
 * ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION ON WORKSTATION
 *
 * A workstation is a device, a remote device, or a virtual device, used by
 * you, your employees, or other entities to whom you have commissioned
 * tasks. For example, the number of workstations may refer to the number
 * of software developers, engineers, architects, scientists, and other
 * professionals who use the PRODUCT on your behalf. The number of
 * workstations is not the number of copies of your end-product that you
 * distribute to your end-users.
 *
 * By purchasing the COMMERCIAL LICENSE, you only pay for the number of
 * workstations, while the number of copies/users of your final product
 * (delivered to your end-users) is not limited.
 *
 * Below are some examples to help you select the right license size:
 *
 * Example 1: Single Workstation License
 * Only one developer works on the development of your application. You do
 * not use separate environments for testing, meaning you design, create,
 * test, and compile your final application on one environment. In this
 * case, you need a license for a single workstation.
 *
 * Example 2: Up to 5 Workstations License
 * Two developers are working on the development of your application.
 * Additionally, one tester conducts tests in a separate environment.
 * You use three workstations in total, so you need a license for up to
 * five workstations.
 *
 * Example 3: Up to 20 Workstations License
 * Ten developers are working on the development of your application.
 * Additionally, five testers conduct tests in separate environments.
 * You use fifteen workstations in total, so you need a license for
 * up to twenty workstations.
 *
 * Example 4: Site License
 * Several dozen developers and testers work on the development of your
 * application using multiple environments. You have a large,
 * multi-disciplinary team involved in creating your solution. As your team
 * is growing and you want to avoid licensing limitations, the best choice
 * would be a site license.
 *
 * UPGRADE POLICY
 *
 * The PRODUCT is versioned according to the following convention:
 *
 *    [MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]
 *
 * 1. COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders can install and use the updated version
 *    for bug fixes free of charge, i.e. if you have purchased a license
 *    for the [MAJOR].[MINOR] version (e.g., 5.0), you can freely install
 *    all releases specified in the [PATCH] version (e.g., 5.0.2).
 *    The license terms remain unchanged after the update.
 * 2. COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders for the [MAJOR].[MINOR] version (e.g., 5.0)
 *    can install and use the updated version [MAJOR].[MINOR + 1] free of
 *    charge, i.e., plus one release in the [MINOR] range (e.g., 5.1). The
 *    license terms remain unchanged after the update.
 * 3. COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders who wish to upgrade their version, but are
 *    not eligible for the free upgrade, can claim a discount when
 *    purchasing the upgrade. For this purpose, please contact us via e-mail.
